# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0 January 1st & 2nd
This day I will do a lot of tutorials, then Jan 3rd is the true start.
What I hope to learn from the #100daysofcode is some C++, HTML and CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, and some Javasript.
Update
I have had a hard time finding good project ideas and resources so I will now start when I get a faster pc sometime within these next two months.
